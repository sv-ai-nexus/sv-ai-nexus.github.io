# Transformative Presentations on AI Security

## Kyeyeon Kim's Industry Insights on Cybersecurity Trends for 2025

[Kyeyeon Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/double73/),
Co-Founder and CTO of [GENIANS](https://www.linkedin.com/company/genians/),
provided a masterful industry perspective on "Cybersecurity Trends for 2025," drawing extensively from insights presented at RSA Conference 2025. His presentation effectively bridged the gap between academic theory and practical implementation challenges facing organizations today.

Kim's comprehensive analysis revealed how Executive Order 14028 ("Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity") continues to drive fundamental shifts in the security landscape. His detailed examination of Zero Trust architecture evolution, supply chain security requirements, and the mandatory deployment of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems across federal agencies demonstrated how regulatory mandates are accelerating AI integration in cybersecurity.

The presentation's strength lay in Kim's practical approach to emerging technologies. He demonstrated how Identity-Centric security models are replacing traditional perimeter defenses, with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and passwordless systems (particularly passkeys) becoming standard rather than exceptional. His analysis of the shift from Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) illuminated how AI enables more granular and dynamic security policies.

Kyeyeon's exploration of Cloud Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPP) revealed how organizations are consolidating previously fragmented security tools into unified platforms. He showed how these integrated approaches enable the data correlation and analysis necessary for AI-powered security operations, while simultaneously reducing the complexity that creates security gaps.

Perhaps most valuable was Kim's discussion of Autonomous Security Operations Centers (SOCs). He outlined how AI is transforming incident response from reactive human-driven processes to proactive automated systems capable of threat hunting, alert triage, and even automated remediation. His examples from real-world deployments provided tangible evidence of AI's transformative impact on security operations.

## Prof. Gail-Joon Ahn's Academic Perspective on the AI-Security Nexus

Professor Gail-Joon Ahn opened the technical presentations with an exploration of "The AI-Security Nexus." His academic perspective provided grounding for understanding how artificial intelligence fundamentally reshapes both offensive and defensive cybersecurity paradigms.

Gail-Joon's presentation examined the dual nature of AI in security contexts. On the defensive side, he demonstrated how AI enables unprecedented capabilities in threat detection, automated incident response, and behavioral analysis that can identify sophisticated attacks invisible to traditional rule-based systems. His examples included machine learning models that can detect zero-day exploits through anomaly detection and AI systems capable of correlating vast datasets to identify coordinated attack campaigns.

However, his most compelling insights focused on the emerging threat landscape created by AI itself. He detailed how adversarial machine learning attacks can manipulate AI security systems, model extraction attacks can steal proprietary algorithms, and prompt injection vulnerabilities can compromise large language models. His discussion of "AI vs AI" scenarios—where attackers use artificial intelligence to probe and exploit AI-powered defenses—illustrated the arms race mentality emerging in cybersecurity.

Particularly illuminating was the framework for building robust AI security systems. He emphasized the importance of adversarial training, model verification techniques, and distributed defense architectures that can withstand coordinated AI-powered attacks.

## Dr. Sunghee Yun's Healthcare AI Security Perspective

Dr. Sunghee Yun from Erudio Bio provided a compelling conclusion to the evening's presentations with insights into securing AI systems in healthcare applications. As co-founder and CTO, <!-- of a company that recently received a $1M Gates Foundation Grant--> Dr. Yun offered unique perspectives on protecting sensitive medical data while leveraging AI for diagnostic breakthroughs.

His presentation on Erudio Bio's Versatile Smart Assay (VSA) platform illustrated the complex security challenges inherent in AI-powered medical devices. His discussion of their semiconductor-based diagnostic technology revealed how hardware-level security features can protect against both traditional cyber attacks and novel AI-specific threats like model poisoning or adversarial examples designed to compromise diagnostic accuracy.

The healthcare perspective proved particularly valuable because medical AI systems face unique threat models. Dr. Yun explained how attacks against diagnostic AI could have life-threatening consequences, requiring security measures that go beyond traditional data protection to ensure algorithmic integrity and availability. His examples of partnerships with Bundang Seoul National University General Hospital and Shanghai General Hospital demonstrated how international collaboration in healthcare AI requires sophisticated privacy-preserving security architectures.

# Emerging Themes and Technical Insights

## The Adversarial AI Challenge

A central theme throughout the evening was the emergence of adversarial AI as both a defensive tool and an attack vector. The presentations collectively revealed how the same AI capabilities that enable sophisticated threat detection can be weaponized to create unprecedented attack scenarios.

Dr. Ahn's academic framework provided the theoretical foundation for understanding adversarial machine learning, while Kim's industry experience demonstrated how these attacks manifest in real-world scenarios. The discussion revealed how traditional security assumptions—such as the predictability of attack patterns—become invalid when adversaries can use AI to generate novel attack vectors faster than human defenders can respond.

## AI-Powered Defense Evolution

The presentations painted a picture of security operations undergoing fundamental transformation through AI integration. Rather than simply adding AI features to existing tools, organizations are rebuilding their entire security architectures around AI-native platforms.

Kim's examples of autonomous SOCs illustrated how AI enables security operations that were previously impossible. The ability to correlate massive datasets, identify subtle attack patterns, and respond at machine speed represents a qualitative leap beyond traditional security approaches. However, this transformation requires new skills, new organizational structures, and new approaches to human-AI collaboration.

## Privacy and Compliance in AI Security

While not the primary focus, privacy considerations permeated the discussions. Dr. Yun's healthcare examples highlighted how privacy-preserving AI techniques enable security applications that would otherwise violate patient confidentiality. The challenge of maintaining privacy while enabling the data sharing necessary for effective AI security emerged as a critical consideration.
